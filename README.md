# Data Engineering Roadmap 2025 🚀

![banner](https://img.shields.io/badge/Data%20Engineering-2025-informational?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a)

Welcome to the **Data Engineering Roadmap 2025**! This repository documents my hands-on journey towards mastering data engineering skills using Python, Pandas, SQLite, and industry-standard best practices. Each notebook and script here is a step in building robust, scalable data solutions as part of my **#LearningInPublic** commitment.

## ✨ Main Goals

- Build a solid foundation in data engineering concepts and tools.
- Develop ETL pipelines using Python and Pandas.
- Work with real datasets, perform cleaning, transformation, and datastore loading.
- Practice SQL and database design with SQLite and learn to optimize queries.
- Share daily progress, code, and insights publicly for accountability.
